# DRL Prod Infra Using Terraform

This repository contains Terraform codes which used to spin up Prod environment on Google Cloud. The code is organized into modules and uses the [drl-tf-state](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/drl-tf-state;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&project=drl-simulator-prod) storage bucket as backend for state storage and remote execution.

## Setting Up Environment
To use this code, you will need to have Terraform installed on your local machine. You will also need to have an access to GCP environment.

To initialize the Terraform backend and install the required modules, run:
- Install terraform 

```html
https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli
```

- Gcloud should be configured
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project drl-simulator-prod
``` 

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/thedroneracingleague/drl-infra-prod.git
```
To initialize working directory
```bash
  terraform init
```

To do a plan

```bash
  terraform plan
```

To apply the resources

```bash
  terraform apply
```

To plan selected module

```bash
  terraform plan -target=module.cloud-run
  terraform plan -var-file="secrets.tfvars" -target=module.secrets
```

To apply selected module


```bash
  terraform apply -target=module.cloud-run
  terraform apply -var-file="secrets.tfvars" -target=module.secrets
```

ðŸ’¡ *secrets.tfvars* should be have variable like this
```bash
secrets = [
  {
    name  = "USERNAME"
    value = "STRONG-KEY"
    label = "all"
  },
  {
    name  = "FOO"
    value = "BAR"
    label = "backend"
  }
]
```
